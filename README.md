# Complaint-Management-System
The Complaint Registration and Resolution System (CRRS) is a web-based Java application designed to streamline the process of logging, tracking, and resolving complaints efficiently. Built using JSP, Servlets, and Hibernate ORM, the system allows users to register complaints, view complaint history, and track resolutions with time-based analytics (TAT). Admins or support staff can resolve complaints, add remarks, and view performance metrics. The system supports dynamic search, form validation, and visually distinct resolution statuses to enhance usability and responsiveness.
